        <h2>What We Offer</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            12 servers for playing Rust:
            <ul>
              <li>8 servers host tournaments that last 7 days.</li>
              <li>4 servers host shorter 2-day tournaments (on weekends).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Each server can accommodate up to 400 players.</li>
          <li>
            Tournament participation requires a small, symbolic entry fee.
          </li>
          <li>
            The prize pool is formed from player contributions—the more players,
            the bigger the prize!
          </li>
          <li>
            There’s only one winner: each server has a single prize slot for the
            best player.
